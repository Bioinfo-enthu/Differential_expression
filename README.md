# Differential Expression Analysis: Explained and Implemented

## Introduction

Differential expression analysis is a crucial aspect of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data analysis, particularly in mRNA sequencing (mRNAseq) experiments. It involves identifying genes whose expression levels vary significantly between different conditions or experimental groups. In this document, we will delve into the methodology, rationale, and practical implementation of differential expression analysis using the DESeq2 package in R.

## Understanding DESeq2

DESeq2 is a widely used method for differential expression analysis in HTS data. It employs negative binomial generalized linear models to model read counts and test for differential expression. DESeq2 normalizes count data using the median-of-ratios method, which adjusts for library size and RNA composition variations across samples.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preparation

We begin by preparing our data, which typically involves generating a counts matrix where genes correspond to rows and samples to columns. This matrix is then preprocessed and filtered as necessary.

### 2. Running DESeq2

Using the DESeq2 package, we perform differential expression analysis by modeling count data with respect to experimental variables of interest. We'll demonstrate this process step by step, including model design, contrasts, and obtaining differential expression results.

### 3. Diagnostic Plots and Visualization

After running DESeq2, we evaluate the results through diagnostic plots and visualization techniques. These include:

- Histogram of raw p-values to assess the distribution of statistical significance.
- Histogram of log2FoldChange values for significantly differentially expressed genes.
- Scatter/jitter plot of normalized counts for top differentially expressed genes.
- Volcano plot to visualize significance against fold change for all genes, with annotations for differentially expressed genes.

### 4. Functional Analysis with fgsea

Finally, we perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the fgsea package. This allows us to identify enriched biological pathways or gene sets associated with our differentially expressed genes.

## Conclusion

Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 is a powerful tool for uncovering biological insights from HTS data. By following the outlined steps and methodologies, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of gene expression dynamics and their implications in various biological processes.
